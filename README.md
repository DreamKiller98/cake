Red Velvet Cake
3 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 Tablespoons unsweetened natural cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened to room temperature
2 cups castor sugar
1 cup vegetable oil (not olive)
4 large eggs, separated
1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon white vinegar
liquid or gel red food coloring
1 cup buttermilk
Cream Cheese Frosting
400 grams cream cheese
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
3 cups icing sugar
1 Tablespoon cream or milk
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Instructions
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 8 inch cake pans. I only had one pan .. so I baked the cakes one at a time.
Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Put aside.

With a handheld mixer or whisk, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined. Add in the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.)
Add the dry ingredients in 2-3 parts alternating with the buttermilk. Add in the food colouring (however red you like) until combined (today I had none, fret not, this doesn’t change the cake taste. Whisk the 4 egg whites till foamy/firm. fold into cake batter.
Divide batter between 2 cake pans. I only had one pan so I baked them one at a time. Bake for 30-40 mins. careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool. The cakes must cool before frosting. Blend all frost ingredients together. Then slice the tops of the cakes off to make them flat. Frost cake one. Stack the 2nd and frost also. Refrigerate for 1hr & enjoyyy 🐷. This cake tastes even better a day later.
